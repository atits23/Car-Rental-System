# Car-Rental-System
esign a Car Rental System in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming, operated via the command line. The system should:

Track which cars are rented by each customer or employee.

Allow renting only if the user has a good rental history, updated based on late returns or vehicle damage.

Maintain separate records for customers, employees, and cars.

Include three main roles:

Customer: Can view and rent cars (limited by their record), see current rentals, and is fined for late returns. New users start with an average record.

Employee: Same as customer, but gets a 15% discount.

Manager: Can add, update, or remove customers, employees, and cars. Can also view all rentals and their users.

Use proper OOP concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism. Ensure appropriate use of private/public members and class methods.

Start with 5 customers, 5 employees, 5 cars, and 1 manager. Default values can be assumed where needed.
